TRADE ALERT
USD/JY
The move down looks very corrective, which places the odds towards a
new challenge of the 100 level.
I am going to reverse out of my short trade and then go long if the
market hits 99.00 (currently 98.84).
John
----------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
NIKKEII have been following the Nikkei closely for some time and
projected a move to the 14,000 area (a Fib level) - see my previous
coverage.  The market has reached 14,000 and is currently trading
slightly above it.
The bullish tide has lifted all boats, including the Nikkei, which has
doubled in just a few months.  This is an incredible performance,
considering that Japanese stocks have been shunned for years until
last year.  It shows what a change in sentiment can produce.
And I believe there is a change in sentiment going on right now in
equities from positive to negative.
The Nikkei has formed patterns very similar to the Dow and S&P and
this morning, it has broken through the lower tramline after a big neg
mom div.  
Will post a chart in my next FMT blog.
I hope this is a significant omen for the Dow.  Jobless Claims out
later today.
I may have a Nikkei trade shortly.

TRADE ALERTSYesterday, I discovered that not all of my Trade Alerts
are arriving at your inbox in a timely way.  If you have experienced
any delay, please let me know. 
If you receive a delayed email, you will likely notice my trade prices
are different from that on your screen, but my entries and exits are
genuine!  It does take me a few moments to compose the Alert, and in
a fast market - which I try to avoid - prices may be somewhat
different when you check.
DOWYes, we are coming to the final top.  Latest sentiment readings
are in the stratosphere.  Everyone is now on board  the rocket to
the moon.  Yesterday, I had a W5 = W1 target in the S&P of 1644.
 This morning, it is trading at 1655, slightly above.
The equivalent target in the Dow is 14,364 - now at 15,250, so there
is another 100 pips or so to go - if it makes it.
This means the top could come at any time.  Stand by for fireworks.
John

----------------------------------------------------
TRADE ALERT
DOW

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

The Tramline Traders website has been operating for almost a month and
already, it is clear to Naomi and myself that we need to make major
changes to our website and memberships. The format is too complicated
and we need to set one blog in full on the home page.
We shall be working on these changes very shortly, but in the
meantime, we feel it is unfair to ask you to pay £97 for your second
and subsequent months.  Therefore, we will keep the £17 monthly rate
until we re-launch.  I have made the changes on our site.
I will keep you updated about progress, but in the meantime, you will
not see any change.
Thank you for your loyalty, and I'm sure you will like the new site.
Best Wishes,
John BurfordTRAMLINE TRADERS

FOLLOW MY TRADES



You have seen how I use my unique Tramline Trading methods not only
to extract profits from the winners, but also to minimize losses on
the losing trades.

 The correct attitude to achieving success is to ride the winners
and cut the losers.  For many, this is easier said than done.  The
problem is this: there is no way on earth that can identify a trade
as a winner or a loser ahead of time!  You have to play the
percentages.

My A-B-C Strategy

But with my simple but effective system for setting up three
accounts in one, it is as easy as ABC!   Here's how:

          'A' Account - used for short-term moves (hours and days)

          'B' Account - used for medium-term moves (days and weeks)

          'C' Account - used for long-term moves (weeks and months)

 And I don't need to set up three separate accounts with my
provider - I just make one bet and peel off the trades one by one
as targets are hit.

 Here is an example of this system in use:

This is the Aussie dollar which I shorted in May

.On 5 May, I shorted the AUS/USD in the 102.50 area on a major
tramline break.  I placed equal bets in the three accounts.  I
placed my protective stop at 50 pips above entry, giving me a very
low-risk trade.
 FINDING LOW-RISK ENTRIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM PROFITS!

 And as the market went my way, I took a 100 pip profit for A
Account on an oversold momentum/tramline hit.  And I still had the
B and C trades working.

 Then, as the market declined further, I took a 300 pip profit for
B Account on a Fibonacci retrace.  And I still had the C Account
trade open.

 As I write, I have taken 400 pips for A and B Accounts off the
table, and have an open gain of 600 pips in the C Account.

 The minimum size bet is three pips - one pip in each of the three
accounts with the initial protective stop 50 pips away for all
three.

 That is a potential profit of 1000 pips on a 3 pip spread bet, and
at only £5 per pip, that is a £5,000 potential gain (remember, I
still have the C Account trade working, so this gain has not been
realized in this account).

 Of course, these trades do not come along every day, but to take
advantage, I need to keep my eyes open for them.

Now, I believe my service could be of great benefit to traders of
all levels, from the novice to the much more experienced.
 It can teach you what clues to look for - and help you with the
discipline required to put my methods into practice.

 The novice trader in particular will gain valuable insights into
the anatomy of a trade, from the initial analysis using tramlines,
Fibonacci levels and Elliott Waves, to the correct use of money
management discipline.

 Most traders lose money not because they are lousy analysts!  They
lose because they are unable to bring sufficient discipline into
their risk management - and many take profits too early.

 My A-B-C strategy is a wonderful way to manage market risk while
riding a potential whale!

 And if you subscribe, you will receive Trade Alerts when I exit a
trade for any one of the accounts.

YOU WILL RECEIVE MY TRADE ALERTS BY EMAIL AND NOW YOU HAVE THE

I have been out of the office for most of today and consequently
missed the big declines in many of my markets.
It does appear we have a turn in gold (suggested in MC today), US
stocks (suggested in MW Trader emails), currencies, Treasuries.  The
European stock indexes are holding up much better.
I will be looking to position short again on rallies from here.
 There is plenty of time to climb aboard gold and the Dow, Nasdaq, as
I remain convinced the declines will be historic.
If you have taken the opportunity to go short, then congratulations.

ALCOA
I am warming to ALCOA again (see previous post)  It is nudging big
downtrend line and with Dow etc in melt-up, Alcoa should follow.
 When we do get a turn down in the major indexes, Alcoa should hold
up well as it is already on the floor and is totally unloved and short
interest must be small or even non-existent (I must check).
I HAVE JUST GONE LONG ALCOA @ 8.10 WITH STOP @ 7.70 FOR A SWING TRADE.
I have also been accumulating the shares as an investment (long term).
See previous posts for rationale and charts.

The Dow is running towards the Fib 78% retrace at the 15,320 area.
 Remember, I have been commenting for months that after a decline,
the retrace is usually very deep - at the 78% level or even above.
 This is wave 2 and such a deep retrace is entirely in chacter.

TRADE ALERT
I was short the Dow from August.  On the rally back up, I have exited
these trades at either break-even or for small profit
That was disappointing, but I believe there are riches just around the
corner.
If you are trading short the Dow, I hope you have done something
similar.
The big day is tomorrow - at around 7 pm UK time, and I have a trade
set-up which I will place ahead of time as a stop order.
Tomorrow late could be very wild, and getting a fill in a fast market
could be impossible.  By placing a stop entry order, I will be
assured of a decent fill, if my price is hit.  If it isn't, no harm
done.
NASDAQ
I will enter an order to short the Nasdaq @ 3160 on stop.  If filled,
I will enter protective stop @ 3190.

The news is out and the Fed are not changing a thing - against most
'experts' expectations for at least a $10 billion taper.
Be that as it may, this places my gold and T-Bond positions in good
shape as both have rallied strongly. Remember, both have suffered from
extreme bearish sentiment recently and are due for a good pop.
And stocks have also rallied  - so my open order to short Nasdaq went
unfilled.  I have cancelled that order, so no harm done.
In today's MW Trader email I had a 1.61 target for GBP/USD and we have
come within 20 pips as I write.  I shall be watching the action for
signs of a top.
But thank you Fed, for juicing my gold and T-Bond trades!

Dear FMT Subscriber,

Later today, we are switching into the new website format - keeping
the tramlinetraders.com URL.  I will post regular blogs on the home
page, and you are welcome to check in regularly.
For the past few weeks while we have been wrestling with building the
new site, I have kept the FMT subscription at a very nominal level at
£17 a month to help compensate you for the upheaval.
The good news is that I will continue to offer FMT, but at a more
realistic $47 per month.  I'm sure you recognise what tremendous
value this is as I am confident  you have picked up some great
trading ideas already.  And there are lots more to come!.
I WILL ASK YOU TO CANCEL YOUR EXISTING SUBSCRIPTION AND RE-SUBSCRIBE
IN THE NEW FORMAT (FROM SATURDAY SHOULD BE FINE).  
After that, if you believe you have paid for a significant unused
portion of the existing period and would like a refund, then get back
to me giving your bank details and I will arrange a refund of that
portion.
I am excited by the change and once again, many thanks for your
patience during this difficult period.  I hope you like the new
format!
Best Wishes,
John BurfordTRAMLINE TRADERS

RE: TRAMLINE TRADERS WEBSITE
We are having problems with the switch-over to the new site and some
readers are not able to view it.
I am working on it as fast as I can and hope to have it up and running
very soon.

alternative site, so keep checking there.

TODAY IS SWITCH-OVER DAY
If you have not already done so, please cancel your old Paypal
arrangement with us today and sign in again using the new platform.
If you do not renew, you will cease to receive my Trade Alerts.
Many thanks for your cooperation.
We have had a few annoying stop-outs recently - in addition to the big
gains in T-Bonds.  This weekend could see volatility expand as
political deadlock in US Congress looms.  A positive outcome should
send stocks soaring.  But that is a gamble too far for me!  I shall
watch and wait for now.
